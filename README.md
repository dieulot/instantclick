## InstantClick

For information about what InstantClick is, how it works, etc., go to where I forked this from **[InstantClickâ€™s website](https://github.com/dieulot/instantclick/)**.

## Changes


Added HTTP_X_INSTANTCLICK / X-INSTANTCLICK header to specify version number and detect the presence of Instantclick for the server environment.
